vcrud.php

Version 1.2.0 - 2024/06/07

I created this (with the help of OpenAI) to use with all my various API
projects I work on. This handles basic CRUD operations against the
database. This is surprisingly flexible after adding the AND/OR options
to the read command.

functions:
    create(table,fields): takes an associative array and tries to insert
        it into the database under the provided table. Returns false if
        it fails, and the last inserted ID if successful.

    read(table,conditions,[orOperand]): Pulls records from the database 
        that match "conditions". Conditions are a three-part array 
        containing a field name, a string operand (=,<,>,LIKE,etc.) and 
        a value. Default is to AND the conditions, but setting orOperand
        to true will OR the conditions

    update(table,fields,conditions,[orOperand]): Updates records from the database
        matching conditions with the values from the associated array
        fields.

    delete(table,conditions,[orOperand]): Removes records from the database that meet
        conditions.
